# ButterCMS Content Migration Implementation with Express.js

Migrating Content from Butter Blog Engine to Pages using the Write API

This repository contains an Express app for migrating content into ButterCMS by getting the content from the ButterCMS Read API and creating new custom blog pages with ButterCMS Write API.

This Express API can be used by cloning or downloading the repository and providing the Read and Write API key.

With little tweaks and changes to the fields, you can refactor this script to migrate your own content into your content types on ButterCMS.
